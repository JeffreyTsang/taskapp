# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. Team name or project name. Plus full name and NetID of each of your team members.

Git & Tonic: 
Jungwon Shin (js2888), Angela Zheng (az428), Isabelle De Brabanter (id96), Jeffrey Tsang (jet253), Grace Song (gs488), Priya Kankanhalli (pk446)

2. To what goals do we all commit?

Git & Tonic commits to investing time, energy, and dedication into our final deliverable. We aim to create a final project that we would be  proud to feature in our portfolios. 

3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

No last minute work  — the quality of rushed work will be poor and bring down the entire group grade.
Stick to assigned deliverable deadlines — if you cannot meet your deliverable deadline, inform the team at least 2 days before the deliverable deadline.
Allocate and delegate work equally — if, for some reason, a fair split is not achieved in one milestone, it will be made up in the next milestone/deliverable.
One Mic - respect each other by not interrupting and receiving ideas and comments with friendly spirits without cutting anyone off.

4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

We will attempt to meet at least once a week, before every milestone deadline, and more frequently if the volume of work demands it. We are generally available on Mondays and Wednesdays after 4:10 PM.
We will be open and communicative with each other and Professor Harms regarding our progress on individual contributions. 
We will communicate through our private Slack Channel: https://info4340-fa2018.slack.com/messages/GCYBR5NTY/details/. 
We plan to meet up outside of class for coffee or gin and tonics! 

5. How will we communicate and work with our client?

N/A

6. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

The roles are general suggestions and will not be strictly enforced. These roles will be cycled/rotated throughout the semester so that each group member can learn different sectors of development. 

Deadline Tracker -- this group member is responsible for checking up on each individual group member and assessing progress daily on the overall milestone. With the support of the group, they may reassign responsibilites as they see fit to meet a deadline.

Design Expert -- this group member will make executive decisions about overall design with focus on UX; however, design must be approved by the whole team. This role will be for more nit-picky items and choices. 

Code Quality Expert -- this group member is responsible for running the completed code for any milestone on their device as well as assuring compatibility with multiple different browsers/formats. They will also sweep through the code base and enforce consistency and precision in the code. They will bring any remaining bugs to the attention of the group.

Documentation Expert -- this group member is responsible for confirming that all documentation, after completion, is thorough and logical. They will track changes from previous versions of the document to the next and ensure that all members are complying with the written protocol.

Course Staff Correspondent -- this group member is responsible for handling communication with the course staff should the occasion for direct contact arise -- questions, concerns, request for additional feedback or guidance, etc. This member will also proactively share any foreseeable delays or disruptions with the group project to the course staff. 

Health Tracker -- group projects can be stressful! This group member will check in with each teammate on a weekly basis to ensure that workload is managable, the project is generally enjoyable, and no unspoken conflicts are brewing under the surface.

7. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

Deliverables for each group member will be assigned per milestone. If a member appears to not be contributing as much, the other members will communicate with that member directly and distribute the work more evenly; transparency is key. If a member fails to deliver what was promised, the other two members will let that member know and provide help if needed.

8. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

If the conflict is a yes/no decision, a voting process should take place. The design choice with at least at simple majority of votes will be implemented. If there is conflict related to a concept or theme, a compromise must be met. If a compromise cannot be reached, the group should approach and consult a TA.

9. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

Amendments can be made if everyone in the group approves of it. The contract should be enforced and re-visited if there is a misalignment of expectations in terms of time or effort.

10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

Git and Tonic aspires to build a team more than just for a project. We believe that the quality of work increases when each other believes and trusts other teammates. In order to achieve that, we plan to meet outside working for the project and have coffee chat and/or dinner.
