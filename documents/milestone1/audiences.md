Three very different, specific audience would be ideal. 
Think about how we present the data later after input. 



### Audience 1
```
People who exercise and run to track their distance and time spent running or walking
```

This would be an audience of motivated individuals who are serious about exercising and monitoring their health. This sort of demographic would be suitable for a tracking device, as the demographic would want to be aware of their activity levels and the division of what they have done throughout the day. 
This is an appropriate audience because this audience often wants to track how long they ran and the distance they ran. It will also encourage people to exercise, since exercise is a task and not a demographic. There are a wide variety of people that run. There may be a map to visualize distance.
We could reach out to athletes on-campus, health-concious individuals, or by recruiting students in the running club.


### Audience 2
```
People who want to track their weekly schedule/goals.
```

This is an appropriate audience because this audience often wants to track their goals and schedule in an organized fashion. This will be helpful for a wide variety of people because many individuals want to organize their goals and tasks for the a particular day or week. 
Placing goals on a calendar will help visualize their schedule. 
This type of application would be catered to people who are adamant about remaining organized and like creating checklists. They are likely to be busy individuals with too many tasks to remember in their head. 
A tracking application would be helpful for this demographic to reach their goals and remember their tasks. Once tasks are completed, users would have the satisfaction of checking off an element. 
We will have access to this population by recruiting students on campus and faculty on campus. Generally, anyone who has a weekly schedule and goals will be appropriate.


### Audience 3
```
People who want to track spending.
```

This is an appropriate audience because this audience wants to keep track of their spending.  This will be helpful for a wide variety of people because many individuals want to monitor their expenditures. Tabulating and conputing weekly expenditures and monthly expenditures will be helpful . 
Perhaps they want to ensure that they are not overspending or want to create a structured plan around how they want to create future budgets. This application would be helpful in situations when the user wants to check how much they are allowed to spend for the next given period of time, or plan for the future. 
We will have access to this population by recruiting students on campus and faculty on campus. Generally, anyone who spends money will be an appropriate audience.

//suggestions: 
be even more specific 
ex: club treasure


### Audience 4
```
People who want to track time spent on phone
```

A tracking application could be useful for people who are easily distracted by their phone and want to understand their phone usage habits. This application can increase awareness around time wasted on phones in order to help alleviate that effect. 
This could be helpful given the trend in people wanting to put down phones to enjoy the environment in front of them. 
There are currently apps like Pocket Points where users are discouraged from using phones with an incentive; however, our application would simply be for tracking purposes, so users themselves can make decisions based on the facts the collect about phone usage 
For this demographic we could reach out to smart-phone users and there are many smart phone users on campus that we can access.


### Audience 5
```
People who want to track their health progress. 
```

The audience in this scenario is formed around the task of becoming healthy. The tracking app would be useful to this audience, especially due to the rise of health tracking watches and the increase of people wanting to become healthy/fit today. 
Some things the app can track are weight changes, muscle-to-fat ratio changes, eating habit changes, etc. We will have access to this population by targeting college students who like to workout. We can go to the fitness centers on campus and recruit users. 


### Audience 6
```
People who want to track people's locations.

```

The audience in this scenario is formed around the task of looking out for others' safety. The tracking app could be helpful for college students are concerned about their friends' safeties when they go out to parties and socials at night to over the weekend. 
In addition to this, the tracking app could also be helpful if people want to find their friends for studying purposes or to hang out. We will have access to this population by targeting college students who would like to use tracking apps/want to try different tracking apps - those who are already using apps like Life360 and Find My Friends.


### Audience 7
```
People who want to track the books they've read
```

This is an appropriate audience for this project because this audience is oriented around the task of reading, it is not purely demographic. 
This platform is relevant in the situation, "what have you read recently?" or "what is your favorite book?". 
A tracking app could be very useful in this case. 
We will have physical access to this population by targeting college students who free read. 
We could reach out to English majors or students involved in book clubs. 


### Audience 8
```
People who want to track at which restaurants they've eaten at in different cities. 
```
This audience is appropriate because it is focused around the task of eating. 
A tracking app would be helpful in this sitation because you can remember where you ate and if you liked that restaurant.
This app would be particularly helpful for college students abroad who want to track where they are eating when they are traveling.
We will have physical access to these kinds of students by contacting the Study Abroad office and reaching out to seniors who have come back from their semester away from Ithaca.
