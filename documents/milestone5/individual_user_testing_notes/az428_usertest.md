## Scenario 2 ## 
### Part A ###
Goes immediately to check spending, checks category food, and specifies amount, but does not adjust date/time
### Part B ###
Goes to Analytics and scrolls to November
Asks wouldn’t you have to set a budget to see spending limits? Assume it would be under analytics or spending, but I don’t see antyghin about . Sees monthly spending goal is default: 1000, but doesn’t seem to be a UI element telling you if your over or under this. 
c.) Clicks around spending page to “add spending”. “I don’t know how to do that”

## Scenario 1 ##
Scrolls through to the adding todo items list 
Navigtes easily, scrolls back and forth a little, asks what date and time is for (is it when it’s due?) 
Makes up random task 
Seems okay going through it, 
Asks if he needs to do 3 of these 
Goes through the same process of adding a task and deadlines 
Writes in the tree tasks pretty easy
Chooses arbitrary settings for date and time 
Asks what description is for (not intuitive enough) 
Part 1a not as clear. “I feel like the category and added on don’t need to be there, time and detail, or hide everything and display dropdown that shows relevant information.” 
To get rid fo something I’ve checked off, I use GoogleKeep for notes, Likes way GoogleKeeps does it. List of stuff to do and past tasks on the bottom. 
Presses X to get rid of tasks

## Scenario 3 ## 
Creates task vitamins, 
“I don’t know how far I’m soupposed to set this” sets 1pm, and creates task “Did it not submit? Presses submit, but it submits, but doesn’t seem to have entered itself in”. 
“Oh wait” “Oh My , that’s a lot” . “I feel like repeating one’s should be listed once, but made clear in some way that it repeats daily” 
User seemed a little confused about the task given to him at hand 

## Scenario 4 ##
Scrolls all the way down long list, of repeating alarms (from previous scenario) to add new Category. 
User seemed a little frustrating at having to scroll for a relatively long time 
Sets new category “running” relatively easily,and sets the correct time. Submit new task. 
User breezed through actually completing the task, he seemed familiar with the process 

### Additional Comments ### 

Overall user seemed most confused by the tasks given to him at hand
He gave some interesting suggestions
In the end, he said that he was already familiar with his current tracking apps 
The processes seemed intuitive
He thought that the task page seemed clutter especially with the excess detailing
