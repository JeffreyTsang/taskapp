Task 1 - 
No problems. Was executed with the correct logic. 
Task 2 - 
User is confused as to why the spending goal is not under the spending tab and is instead on under the tasks page. Then when the user inputs the spending goal, it displays on the spending page even though you input it on the task page. 
User is very confused on how to edit the spending goal. User clicks on the spending goal number to try and edit and then realized that she had to modify the spending goal on input task page by reinputting the goal all over again. 
When the user inputted monthly spending goals, months did not appear in a chronological order (Decemeber was listed before November). 
User was clicking around a lot randomly for this task, was clearly confused and could not find the right path to get to the task.  
Task 3 - 
When the user executed this task, she made a mistake in the date range. After the task was submitted, she realized this and wanted to correct for her mistake. To do this, she had to delete all of the repeated tasks more than 30 times and then had to repeat the process. Hard for the user to correct, errors are severe. 
Task 4 -  
No problems. Was executed with the correct logic. 

Overall - 
The user would not use this app in real life. It was too difficult to interact with. For this user, the app doesn’t achieve the goal of making things easier. The user also said that the graphic design of the app could be more appealing. For this user, the app logic is not flexible, if the user doesn’t understand the flow they are stuck. User kept saying, “Is this how you want me to do it?”, which suggests that the logic was not universal and that there seems to be only one way to use the app. If the user doesn't understand this way, they are scared to use the app incorrectly.
