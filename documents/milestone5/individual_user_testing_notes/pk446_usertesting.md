User Test: Priya (pk446)


Task Order: 1,3,2,4


Scenarios:
- You want to input 3 to-do items and upcoming deadlines on a platform that can be accessed on a mobile device and a computer. ***NOTES:*** user performed task successfully and with ease after familiarizing with application.
- You’re frustrated by the clutter on your other calendar apps, and you don’t want to see completed assignments and tasks. You want to declutter your task list. ***NOTES:*** this task was performed intuitively although user asked for some clarity on task instructions (“should I delete all the ones I inputted?”)
- You want to set a spending goal of $100/month to keep yourself in check. ***NOTES:*** user performed task with ease but commented that “default value of $1000 seems very high.”
- You spent $70 on groceries yesterday, and $40 on gas today. You want to track what you spent so far this month. ***NOTES:*** user completed task with ease. Hesitated a bit before selecting ‘Miscellaneous’ category but settled on it after a few moments. Entering Details was met with some resistance -- the user felt the prior fields captured all the required information
- You want to check whether you stayed within your budget for the month. ***NOTES:*** navigated to Analytics easily
- You realize that $100/month is is not doable. You want to be more realistic and change your spending goal to $150/month. ***NOTES:*** task took significantly longer to complete than others; was not intuitive. 
- You take daily vitamins after lunch, around 1:00 PM, and it seems tedious to input this task every day. However, you also don’t want to miss any days, so you want to ensure that this task appears on your list daily without having to manually input it. ***NOTES:*** task description seemed to confuse the user but performed it successfully. Navigated to Task Input but lingered there before entering information because user was unsure whether that was the correct page for the task. Repeat functionality reassured the user
- You want to remind yourself to run for 1 hour later today. You run often, but you don’t think this fits any of the existing choices. ***NOTES:*** user completed task with ease; Add New Category was intuitive

Concluding Thoughts:
- Could improve graphic design
- Categorization of medicines with tasks is non-intuitive
- Spending Goal can’t be adjusted easily
- Selecting a month in Analytics caused stumbles
- Some fields should be marked as required so form doesn't seem too daunting
