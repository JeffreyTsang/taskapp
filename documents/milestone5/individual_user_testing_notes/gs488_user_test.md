Additional comments
- The home page list gets too long when to-do list has multiple tasks
      - Annoying to navigate
- More intuitive to have the monthly spending goal form on the spending page
- Is confused why there is a checkbox and remove button on home 
- Is there an undo feature for the remove button in case something was accidentally deleted?
