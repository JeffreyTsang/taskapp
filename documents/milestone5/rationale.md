Rationale for Scenario Revision

Rationale for Scenario Revision and User Testing Methods:
We no longer have monthly/weekly Calendars or reminder features as they are redundant with the information offered on the Daily tasks page. In addition, users preferred to see all tasks and details on one page, so a calendar would be unnecessary. We also removed the pie chart from the Analytics page as visualization needs were met with the existing progress bars. Thus, we decided to change our scenarios to test each of our existing features more thoroughly.  

Rationale for Rearranging Scenarios for each user testing: 
We decided to randomize our tasks because this would prevent users from becoming familiar with the app early into the user testing, which would detract from the novelty of each task and limit the insights it could provide. In addition to this, randomization of the tasks will prevent user fatigue as they go through tasks that may seem repetitive or useless.
