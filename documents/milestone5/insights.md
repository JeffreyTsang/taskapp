## Task 1 ##
- The app is intuitive and is easy to use
	- But is date and time for when the task is due?
- The check box and the delete button appearing on the home page next to each task is confusing for the user
	- Doesn’t know if checkbox deletes the task
	- Also, there is no undo button for when user accidentally deleted a task
- User was confused as to how the repeated part of the form needed to be filled out
	- No markings/text that shows which parts of the form are mandatory
- Task display
	- Not all information or details about tasks need to be displayed - if a user is curious about the corresponding details there should be a drop down where they can see it instead of it automatically displaying on the home page

## Task 2 ##
- User is confused as to why the spending goal is not under the spending tab and is instead on under the tasks page. Then when the user inputs the spending goal, it displays on the spending page even though you input it on the task page. 
- User is very confused on how to edit the spending goal. User clicks on the spending goal number to try and edit and then realized that she had to modify the spending goal on input task page by re-inputting the goal all over again. 
- When the user inputted monthly spending goals, months did not appear in a chronological order (December was listed before November). 
- User was clicking around a lot randomly for this task, was clearly confused and could not find the right path to get to the task.  
- It would be helpful to see a running sum of expenses
- The default expense of 1000 seems to be high. 500 may be more appropriate.

## Task 3 ##
- When the user executed this task, she made a mistake in the date range. After the task was submitted, she realized this and wanted to correct for her mistake. To do this, she had to delete all of the repeated tasks more than 30 times and then had to repeat the process. Hard for the user to correct/recover, errors are severe. 
- Not intuitive for users to set up the repeated feature
- One user wanted repeated items to be displayed once with range instead of once a day for a certain range
- Would be nice to have a way to set a task to appear for an indefinite time
- Not intuitive for medicine to be grouped with tasks

## Task 4 ##
- Not much commentary from users, easy to navigate
- Liked how you can type in your own category and it will be added to the current list of categories
- One user said “this was intuitive and made the app generalizable”

## Overall ##
- The home page list gets too long when to-do list has multiple tasks (annoying to navigate)
- Users are confused why there is both a checkbox and remove button
	- Is there an undo feature for the remove button in case something was accidentally deleted?
- Setting a spending goal is confusing since it is not on the spending screen
- Users liked customizability 
- Setting categories for your tasks was easy
