Introduction:
Hello! My name is _____, and I’m a student in INFO 4340: UX and Software Development Studio. Thank you for participating in this user interview! I anticipate this interview will take around 15 minutes, and it will include a some basic questions and four short scenarios that will encourage you to interact with our application. I highly encourage you to think aloud and tell me your thought process. The goal of this interview is to gain an understanding of how you track your activities and goals. I will be taking notes during this interview to capture your thoughts.

Remember, there are no right or wrong answers. Let’s get started!

Basic Questions: 	
	What is your name? What is your major? How old are you?

Interaction with App:
Please navigate to https://git-tonic.herokuapp.com/ on your preferred device (mobile or desktop). We will now give you a few tasks to complete in order to interact with this tracking app. 

Scenarios:
1. You want to input 3 to-do items and upcoming deadlines on a platform that can be accessed on a mobile device and a computer.
You’re frustrated by the clutter on your other calendar apps, and you don’t want to see completed assignments and tasks. You want to declutter your task list.
2. You want to set a spending goal of $100/month to keep yourself in check. 
You spent $70 on groceries yesterday, and $40 on gas today. You want to track what you spent so far this month. 
You want to check whether you stayed within your budget for the month.
You realize that $100/month is is not doable. You want to be more realistic and change your spending goal to $150/month.
3. You take daily vitamins after lunch, around 1:00 PM, and it seems tedious to input this task every day. However, you also don’t want to miss any days, so you want to ensure that this task appears on your list daily without having to manually input it.
4. You want to remind yourself to run for 1 hour later today. You run often, but you don’t think this fits any of the existing choices.

Conclusion:
This concludes our user interview. Thank you so much for your time! If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at _____@cornell.edu.
