**Components for MVP**

To incorporate all of the needs of our three audiences, the following project themes will be integrated into our general tracking app.

1. Integrate calendar features into goal tracking
2. Allow users to track *and* mark completed goals
3. Visually represent analytics that show progress towards a certain goal
4. For food-related spending, visualize current expenditures relative to spending goal through percentages
5. Include reminder function that alerts users of approaching deadlines or goals/tasks to be completed, take their medication on time or to prompt users to input daily expenditures
