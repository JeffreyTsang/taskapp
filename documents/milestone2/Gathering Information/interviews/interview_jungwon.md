**Audience 3 - Medicine**

What is your name? What is your major? How old are you?
Shannon, Computer Science, 20

Do you have a medication you have to take regularly?  (vitamins, birth control, personalized medicine)
I take prescribed medications after dinner. 

Preface by saying would u be comfortable with telling me your medications.
How often do you have to take the medication(s)?
I have to take it every night after dinner and before I go to bed.

How do you track whether or not you have taken the medication(s)?
I just try to remember, but sometimes it is hard to remember and I question myself whether I had taken it or not. I mean, I don't actually track it; I base it on my memory. 

What do you do to remember to take your medication(s)?
I don’t do anything specific to remember. Maybe look inside the pill case and count how many are left? 
 
Have you ever forgotten to take a medication?
Yup, of course (chuckles).

What made you forget?
I was having a fun time with friends and forgot and just went to bed. 

What did you do to avoid it afterward? 
I try to take it right after dinner, so I don’t have to remember when I am hanging out with friends and then go to bed.

Do you want to track your medication intake?
That will be helpful, but I don’t know how that will help me remember because I still have to remember to check the app? 

How would you want to track it? Any suggestions? 
Umm, since I already said that I am not sure how it will help me remember, I don’t really have a good idea of how it should be like. I guess I can mark off when I take the med and if I leave it empty I get a notification or something like that.
