Audience 1: People who track their accomplished weekly academic schedule/goals
Victoria Chang, AEM, 21
    How many classes are you in?
Currently taking 5 classes
    Can you describe your daily routine?
Um, I wake up pretty early in the morning and then I go back to sleep and wake up and go back to sleep. Usually an hour before I have to get to class, I check my phone.Wash face, brush teeth, put on contacts, put on makeup and clothing and shoes. Go downstairs make breakfast with eggs and eat it. And then, I go to my class and then after my class I usually go to Warren or library and do work sometimes with other people. Sometimes I go to my other classes. After that I go home. If Tuesday or Thursday I go immediately to softball. Otherwise, I hang around, make some food and sometimes I go back to the library otherwise I’m just at home.
