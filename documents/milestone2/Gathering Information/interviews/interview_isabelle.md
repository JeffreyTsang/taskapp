### Audience 1 Interview - People who track their accomplished weekly academic schedule/goals

*What is your name? What is your major? How old are you?*

Erin, Information Science, 20 

*How many classes are you in?*

5

*Can you describe your daily routine?*

Wake up, eat breakfast if time, go to first class, if breaks then i find a library usually in the statler to do some small homework thing, finish class at 5, if no meeting then come home to make dinner and then go to ehub/duff to do homework usually until midnight/1am and then go home. Post dinner depends on group work 

*How do you manage your academic schedule?*

Dont have a planner, tried using a planner/calendar, hard for me to write down whats due, i keep track of big things like prelims but in terms of everyday assignments i try to remember every day whats due. Its kind of a bad system but i normally just remember what to do, its worked for me for the past two years

*Do you set weekly academic goals based on this schedule?*

Not explicitly

*What types of homework goals do you set for yourself? (grades, handing in 
assignments on time, feeling satisfied with the work produced)*

For short term assignments i do them quickly and hand them in, for long term ones i try to finish it before its due so i can talk about it with friends, if its a big problem set i do it earlier to go to OH; as long as i try my best i feel good and satisfied about what im doing. The grades depend on the class, ill feel better with As in easy classes but then for harder IS classes ill pray for a B and be really happy with that

*Do you track your weekly academic goals? How?*

No, i mean i keep track of if i finished things or not 

*How do you keep track of all your classes/assignments/exams?*

Just remember, like a pattern where something is due every tuesday. I go to check the class websites pretty frequently. I also have a friends in classes so if something is due we are probably talking about it anyway

*What do you do to keep on track?*

Being aware of due dates - as long as i know when its due! 

*Do you check off the items on your goals list?*

Not really for academics but definitely for to do list - sticky app list on desktop

*How often do you check your list?*

It’s really only for days where i feel really overwhelmed 

*Do you want to track your accomplished weekly academic goals?*

Yeah - i want more organization in my life. I mean right now im getting things done but it would be nice to have a vision 

*How would you want to track it? Any suggestions?*

*Something on the laptop while im working, physical planners you need a habit of incorporating that into your life. And my phone i dont like using when im studying/its dead a lot of the time*

*Why do you track your academic goals?*

I like writing down what i have to do and having it in front of me or else i get really stressed about what i have to do. I like seeing it visually.

*Are you comfortable telling me your medications? Do you have a medication you have to take regularly?  (vitamins, birth control, personalized medicine)*

Birth control, vitamins

Every day for birth control. A few times a week (vitamins), more so when I’m sick, try not to take advil too much

Reminders on my phone, write it in my planner, oftentimes I’m in a rush in the morning so i usually have to do it at night

*Have you ever forgotten to take a medication?*

yes

*What made you forget?*

School, just being busy, it totally slipped my mind

*What did you do to avoid it afterward?*

The fear of forgetting once gets you back on track but then you eventually fall off the wagon again.. I guess i wanted to be more organized and pay more attention to my reminders

Yes

*How would you want to track it?*

Maybe By an app where i can just input stuff so i don’t have to manually do reminders, im already on my phone anyways so this would be really helpful
