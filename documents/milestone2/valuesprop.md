**Value Proposition:**

While users may turn to physical or digital calendars or alarm applications for their tracking needs, these alternatives fail to engage and remind users consistently and efficiently because of inconvenient and passive interfaces. Our product, in contrast, will help people who track academic goals, food-related spending, and/or medication usage by interactively motivating them to increase productivity, improve financial management, and maintain healthier lifestyles. To address the forgetfulness typical of users, our application will provide proactive reminders to input desired information and prompts to execute desired goals. Our product will also provide users with the ability to view their progress towards completion of their goals, unlike other applications that track completion alone. Additionally, our application will allow mobile and desktop tracking. However, while our tracking application will effectively mitigate typical nuisances associated with trackers on the market, it does also pose some costs. Users will be required to share sensitive, private medical information; they will be costed time and effort in actively inputting and updating information related to academic goals, food-related budgeting, and medical prescriptions. Yet, the long-term benefits offered by our application justifies these costs.
